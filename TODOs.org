#+TITLE: Hammerspoon Config TODOs
#+STARTUP: overview
#+PROPERTY: cookie-data recursive
#+TAGS: feature refactor doc architecture perf tooling

* Vision
A data-oriented configuration system for Hammerspoon automation.

Users configure their automation using clear, composable concepts:
- *Event Sources* - things that emit events (file watchers, app monitors, USB listeners)
- *Events* - named occurrences with structured data
- *Behaviors* - named handlers that respond to events
- *Subscriptions* - connections between sources, events, and behaviors with filtering
- *Tags* - contextual labels for filtering (:work, :personal, :quiet-hours)
- *Components* - higher-level bundles of config+state+sources+behaviors

The system should be:
- *Declarative* - configuration as data, not imperative code
- *Visualizable* - can see what's configured and what's happening
- *Debuggable* - can trace why something did or didn't trigger
- *Queryable* - can inspect state (via SQLite, REPL, UI)

* Projects [6/41]
** PROJ Configuration as Data [6/18]
Users define automations declaratively using data structures, not procedural code.
Can serialize, validate, and inspect the entire config.

*** DONE Milestone 1: Multiple Instances of the Same Source Type [2/2]
User can create multiple instances of the same event-source type (e.g., two file-watchers watching different directories), each with its own config.

**** DONE Separate event-source class/instance concepts               :refactor:

**** DONE Event-sources can specify what they can emit :feature:

*** NOW Milestone 2: Serializable Config [3/6]
Entire automation config can be represented as a single data structure, serialized to a file, and loaded back.

**** DONE Migrate registry/global APIs to datastructure/local APIs :architecture:
     - [X] event-registry (lib/event-registry.fnl)
     - [X] behaviors-register (lib/behavior-registry.fnl)
     - [X] subscriptions-register (lib/subscription-registry.fnl)
     - [X] subscriptions-index (lib/subscription-registry.fnl)
     - [X] lib/dispatcher.fnl
     - [X] source-types-register (lib/source-registry.fnl)
     - [X] source-instances-register (lib/source-registry.fnl)
     - [X] event-loop

**** DONE Remove external requires from lib/ modules :architecture:
     lib/ modules should have no dependencies on application modules
     (events/, event_sources/, behaviors/).

**** DONE Expand subscription data model :architecture:
     - name: unique identifier for the subscription
     - description: human-readable description
     - behavior: which behavior to invoke
     - event-selector: which events to match (event-name or event-kind)
     - source-selector: which event sources to match
     - require-tags: all tags that must exist on the event-source (placeholder for Contextual Automation)
     - exclude-tags: tags that must NOT exist on the event-source (placeholder for Contextual Automation)
     - Renamed subscribe -> define-subscription, unsubscribe -> remove-subscription
     - Added strict validation (errors on missing behavior/source/event-selector)
     - Moved get-subscribed-behaviors from dispatcher to subscription-registry

**** NEXT Refactor rest of the code to use the event/behavior pattern :refactor:
     - [ ] Migrate active-space-indicator.fnl (space/screen watchers → event sources, menubar update → behavior)
     - [ ] Migrate spoons.fnl (one-shot bootstrap, low value)
     - [ ] Migrate windows.fnl (command library → behaviors, mutable history state)
     - [ ] Migrate config.fnl (declarative keybinding/menu config → modal system on event arch)
     - [ ] Migrate slack.fnl (14 keystroke functions → behaviors)
     - [ ] Migrate chrome.fnl (3 nav functions → behaviors)
     - [ ] Migrate multimedia.fnl (5 media key functions → behaviors)
     - [ ] Migrate emacs.fnl (Emacs integration + IPC-callable functions)
     - [ ] Migrate app-switcher.fnl (2 functions → behaviors)
     - [ ] Keep apps-filter.fnl as shared utility
     - [ ] Skip paper-wm.fnl (Spoon version already running)

**** LATER [#B] Standardize registry constructors and define-*! functions :refactor:
     - All make-*-registry constructors accept an optional initial list of items
     - Split define-*! functions into make-* (pure, creates item) and add-*! (mutates registry)
     - behavior-registry already has this (make-behavior + add-behavior!)
     - source-registry already has this (make-source-type + add-source-type!)
     - subscription-registry needs splitting (define-subscription! -> make-subscription + add-subscription!)
     - event-registry needs splitting (define-event! -> make-event + add-event!)
     - Refactor existing init modules to use constructor list instead of sequential add-*! calls
     - Keep add-*! functions available for runtime use

**** LATER [#C] Explore Clojure Integrant for data-driven config inspiration :architecture:
     - https://github.com/weavejester/integrant
     - component, mount, arachne, duct, etc

*** Milestone 3: Rich Subscription Matching [0/3]
Subscriptions can match events using flexible criteria - multiple event types, hierarchical matching, timing controls.

**** LATER [#B] Consider accepting a set of event-selectors for more flexibility :feature:
     - Currently subscribe-behavior takes a single event-selector
     - Could allow subscribing to multiple event-selectors at once

**** LATER [#C] Add debounce/throttle/delay to subscriptions          :feature:
     - Allow subscriptions to specify timing behavior
     - Useful for high-frequency events like file watchers

**** LATER [#C] Event-hierarchies have schemas that inherit to children :architecture:
     - Event-kinds define schemas
     - Child events inherit and extend parent schemas

*** Milestone 4: Components as First-Class Units [0/2]
User can define a "component" that bundles sources, behaviors, subscriptions, config, and state into a reusable unit.

**** LATER [#C] Define component concept                              :architecture:
     - Has config and state
     - Can be queried for config/state
     - Has event-sources and commands
     - event-source+config+state+commands+presentation

**** LATER [#C] Think of behavior dependency/priority/ordering strategies :architecture:
     - Define execution order when multiple behaviors match
     - Handle dependencies between behaviors

*** Milestone 5: Optimized & Documented [0/3]
System is performant and has comprehensive documentation for users.

**** LATER [#C] Cache ancestor lookups                                :perf:
     - Currently recalculated each time
     - Invalidate cache on derive/underive

**** LATER [#C] Create a tutorial-style doc for the event/behavior pattern :doc:

**** LATER [#C] Create doc explaining 4 orthogonal concepts           :doc:
     - Event-source, Event, Behavior, Subscription
     - How they are independent but compose together

** PROJ Visibility & Debugging [0/6]
Users can see what's configured, what's happening, and why.

** PROJ Contextual Automation [0/3]
Users can make automations context-aware using tags and filtering.
Enables modes, contexts, and conditional behavior.

*** LATER [#A] Define tag attachment to behavior/event-source-instance :architecture:

*** LATER [#B] Disable events, behaviors, subscriptions, tags, sources :feature:
    - Add ability to pause/disable at various levels

    - Builds on subscription data model from Configuration as Data project
    - Filter subscriptions based on event-source tags

** PROJ Expand Configuration Options [0/10]
Users can automate based on more system events.

*** NEXT Create Hotkey event source :feature:
    - Emit events on hotkey press
    - Blocking dependency for migrating: config, windows, slack, chrome, multimedia, emacs, app-switcher

*** LATER [#C] Proper shortcut and configs for expose :feature:
    - Current expose shortcut is ctrl-cmd-e
    - Need configurable shortcuts

*** LATER [#C] Make thumbnail height advisable when #102 lands        :feature:
    - Related to GitHub issue #102
    - Thumbnail height calculation should be configurable/advisable

* DONE Archived [7/7]
** DONE derive should check for cycles                                :feature:
    - Prevent A derives B derives A situations
    - Uses isa? to detect if parent already derives from child

** DONE Make hierarchies non-global                                   :architecture:
