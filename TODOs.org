#+TITLE: Hammerspoon Config TODOs
#+STARTUP: overview

* Event/Behavior System
** LATER Consider accepting a set of event-selectors for more flexibility
   - File: lib/behavior-registry.fnl:22
   - Currently subscribe-behavior takes a single event-selector
   - Could allow subscribing to multiple event-selectors at once

** LATER Consider pausing for global source/event-selector/behavior or specific subscription
   - File: lib/behavior-registry.fnl:85-86
   - Add ability to pause/disable behaviors temporarily
   - Could be global or per-subscription

* Core/Setup
** LATER cliInstall doesn't work due to privileges
   - File: core.fnl:7
   - For now linked manually
   - Need to investigate proper permission handling for hs.ipc.cliInstall

* UI/UX
** LATER Proper shortcut and configs for expose
   - File: active-space-indicator.fnl:44
   - Current expose shortcut is ctrl-cmd-e
   - Need configurable shortcuts

** LATER Make thumbnail height advisable when #102 lands
   - File: app-switcher.fnl:7
   - Related to GitHub issue #102
   - Thumbnail height calculation should be configurable/advisable
